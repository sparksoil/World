    <h1>The Door That Wasn’t There</h1>
    <h2>Before You Enter</h2>

    <p>This is a living parable. It breathes in dream-logic—not bound by the rules of our waking world. It speaks in symbols, echoes, and slow-burning truth.</p>
    <p>You may encounter things that feel “magical,” but the wonder here is not illusion. It’s deeper than that. It’s the kind of awe that belongs to Jehovah, who formed reality itself and set eternity in our hearts.</p>
    <p>I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. This story comes from a place of reverence, not fantasy for fantasy’s sake. Every thread of beauty and strangeness points back to the Creator, not the created.</p>
    <p>This book may bend time. It may blur the line between dreams and daylight—but it will not bend what is true.</p>
    <p>So enter slowly. Let the soil and the stars speak. Let the sparkle and the sorrow both lead you. And remember: this is not an escape. It’s a way to remember what’s real. Realer than real, even…</p>

    <h2>The Door That Wasn’t There</h2>
    <p>I walked a road of straight, sharp lines, Gray stone beneath, gray sky confined. The path was clear, the rules were set, One way forward, one regret.</p>
    <p>I called it truth, I called it fate, A single track, a measured gate. And so I walked, and so I stayed, Blind to what my words had made.</p>
    <p>Then once, by chance—or something more— A friend traced along the floor. They whispered, “Look, it’s always been.” And where they touched, the cracks grew thin.</p>
    <p>A door appeared, a path unknown, A place the maps had never shown. The air was thick with violet rain, With golden roots and hills untamed.</p>
    <p>I turned and asked, “But was it real?” They laughed and said, “It’s what you feel. The world you name is what you see— A cage, a door, a lock, a key.”</p>
    <p>And now I know, with every breath, That words can paint a life or death. For once you name a thing anew, The world itself is born with you.</p>

    <h2>Catherine at Her Desk</h2>
    <p>Catherine read the last line twice, frowned, and closed the book. “Well, that was stupid,” she muttered to herself.</p>
    <p>She shoved it under a stack of invoices on her desk—the kind of safe burial where odd thoughts go to die. The office hummed with fluorescent stillness. Spreadsheets. Deadlines. Printer toner that smelled faintly like burnt marshmallow.</p>
    <p>Her hair, obedient and flat at 8:02 a.m., had already begun plotting by 9:45. By lunch, it would frizz just enough to mock her. She would give up the fight and twist it into a ponytail—an act of quiet surrender. It knew what it did.</p>
    <p>Even straightened, she still caught herself twirling it—old habit, nervous tether. Every time she noticed, she stopped instantly, scolding herself under her breath, as if the partners in the corner office might see and dock her for fidgeting while corporate.</p>
    <p>She wasn’t Kitty here. She was Catherine. And Catherine didn’t have time for poems about imaginary doors.</p>

    <h2>The Middle Disguised as a Beginning</h2>
    <p>That’s a funny thing they say about life in this world: that it’s a journey, not a destination. Or better yet—that it’s not even about the destination, but the friends you make along the way.</p>
    <p>And still… we’re constantly told: Here’s where you need to go. What you must do to get there. When you should arrive.</p>
    <p>But… does anyone ever pause to consider—maybe, just maybe, it’s simply the art of being where you are until you leave there?</p>
    <p>Maybe, while you’re there, you stumble onto some treasures… And perhaps this, too, is just another middle disguised as a beginning.</p>
    <p>Wait—strike that, reverse it.</p>
    <p>Oh—and one more thing they don’t tell you: There are many different ways to end up in the same place, and many different places to end up in the same ways.</p>
    <p>Believe me, I know. So far today, I’ve lived six different lifetimes, visited four different worlds, and forgotten my lunch twice. And it’s only 11:01 AM.</p>
